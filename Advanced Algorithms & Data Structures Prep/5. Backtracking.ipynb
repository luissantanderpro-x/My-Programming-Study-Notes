    "What is backtracking? \n",
    "\n",
    "- backtracking is form of recursion.\n",
    "- general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems.\n",
    "- these are called constraint satisfaction problems. \n",
    "- backtracking is also important when solving combinatorial optimization problems (traveling salesman problem etc.)\n",
    "- it is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates because it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test. \n",
    "- N-Queens problem or Sudoku.\n",

    "\n",
    "Backtracking is also called depth-first search (and vice versa)\n",
    "- 1. for every node the algorithm checks whether the given node can be completed to a valid solution.\n",
    "- 2. if it can not then the whole subtree is skipped (this is the key advantage of backtracking)\n",
    "- 3. it recursively enumerates all subtree of the node."
