    "### Quickselect Algorithm (Hoare's Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is a selection algorithm designed by Tony Hoare\n",
    "- quickselect is a selection algorithm - it is able to find the k-th smallest (largest) item in an unordered array.\n",
    "- it has **O(N)** linear running time in best-case.\n",
    "- in worst-case it has in **O(N^2)** quadratic running time. \n",
    "- Hoare algorithm is an in-place approach - does not need additional memory (huge advantage). \n",
    "\n",
    "- the concept is very similar to that of quicksort\n",
    "- instead of recursing into both side of the array we just take one side when dealing with quickselect – this is how we\n",
    "- this is how we end up with O(N) instead of O(NlogN)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) choose a so-called pivot item at random\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) partition the array (based on the value of the pivot)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) instead of recursion into both sides, we take just one side \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. THE PARTITION PHASE \n",
    "The partition method is just for partitioning the array according to the pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> choose a pivot value at random: we generate a random number\n",
    "        in the range [first_index, last_index]\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> re-arrange the array in a way that all elements less than pivot are on left side\n",
    "        of pivot and others on right. \n",
    "\n",
    "            ~ partition returns with the final position (index) \n",
    "                 of the pivot element\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. THE SELECT PHASE (k=2 so we are after the second largest item) \n",
    "\n",
    "    After partititoning there may be 3 cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.) k == pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "            It means we have found the k-th smallest (largest) item we are after because\n",
    "               this is how partitioning works: there are exactly k-1 items that are\n",
    "            smaller than the pivot (in this case pivot == k)\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.) k < pivot\n",
    "        \n",
    "           The k-th smallest item is on the left side of the pivot, thats why we can\n",
    "            discard the other subarray (unlike quicksort)\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.) k > pivot       \n",
    "\n",
    "            The k-th smallest item is on the right side of the pivot\n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. PERFORMANCE\n",
    "\n",
    "- best-case performance: **O(N)**\n",
    "- worst-case performance: **O(N^2)**\n",
    "- average-case performance: **O(N)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The worst-case running time **O(N^2)** so quadratic running time complexity For Example: We want to find the maximum in a sorted array and we always choose the first element (smallest one) to be the pivot.\n"
