    "### 1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers\n",

    "Hint\n",
    "A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = \"32\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32\n",

    "\n",
    "- 1 <= n.length <= 105\n",
    "- n consists of only digits.\n",
    "- n does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this problem is solved \n",
    "When we're looking for the maximum digit in a number, we're essentially finding the largest digit present in that number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the number 332, the maximum digit is 3.\n",
    "In the number 82734, the maximum digit is 8.\n",
    "In the number 27346209830709182346, the maximum digit is 9.\n",
    "Finding the maximum digit is crucial for determining the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed to sum up to a given decimal number. This is because the maximum digit directly corresponds to the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the maximum digit in a number is 5, then we need at least five positive deci-binary numbers to sum up to that number, because the maximum deci-binary digit is 1, and we need five of them to sum up to 5."
